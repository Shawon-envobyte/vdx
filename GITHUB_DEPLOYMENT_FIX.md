# 🚨 GitHub Actions Deployment Fix

## Issue
The GitHub Actions deployment is failing with the error:
```
E: Unable to locate package python3.12-distutils
```

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

I've already fixed all three Dockerfile variants by removing the problematic `python3.12-distutils` package. The deadsnakes PPA doesn't provide this package for Python 3.12.

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Fixed (main deployment file)
- ✅ `Dockerfile.optimized` - Fixed
- ✅ `Dockerfile.multistage` - Fixed

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

### 1. Commit and Push the Fixed Files
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove python3.12-distutils from Dockerfiles"
git push
```

### 2. Trigger GitHub Actions
The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run when you push to:
- `develop` branch → Deploys to staging
- `main` branch → Deploys to production

### 3. Monitor the Build
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Watch the build progress
4. The build should now succeed

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### Before (Broken):
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -y \
    python3.12 \
    python3.12-dev \
    python3.12-venv \
    python3.12-distutils \  # ❌ This package doesn't exist
    ffmpeg
```

### After (Fixed):
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get install -y \
    python3.12 \
    python3.12-dev \
    python3.12-venv \
    ffmpeg  # ✅ Removed problematic package
```

## 🛠 **Alternative: Manual GitHub Actions Trigger**

If you want to test immediately:

1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Select your workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Choose the branch and run

## 📋 **Verification Steps**

After the fix:
1. ✅ Docker build should complete successfully
2. ✅ Image should be pushed to Google Container Registry
3. ✅ Cloud Run deployment should succeed
4. ✅ Service should be accessible via the provided URL

## 🚀 **Expected Build Output**

You should see:
```
Step #0 - "Build": Successfully built [image-id]
Step #0 - "Build": Successfully tagged gcr.io/[project]/tiktok-downloader
Step #1 - "Push": Pushing to gcr.io/[project]/tiktok-downloader
Step #2 - "Deploy": Service [tiktok-downloader] revision [revision] has been deployed
```

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist**

### Check GitHub Secrets
Ensure these secrets are set in your repository:
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` - Your Google Cloud project ID
- `GCP_SA_KEY` - Service account key JSON

### Verify Service Account Permissions
Your service account needs:
- Cloud Run Admin
- Storage Admin
- Cloud Build Editor
- Service Account User

### Manual Deployment Fallback
If GitHub Actions still fails, use the local deployment scripts:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 -ProjectId "your-project-id"
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./deploy.sh your-project-id
```

**The fix is ready! Just commit and push the changes to trigger a successful deployment.**
